## About Me
Howdy! I'm Alex, an aspiring infosec professional with a passion for CTF's, malware analysis, and malware development.

I'm a current mathematics major at the University of Western Australia, and convert to the world of infosec. Since learning about this field, i've dedicated most of my free-time to exploring all the wonders of this field. This has resulted in many hours spent on CTF's, analysing and reverse-engineering malware, developing malware, pulling apart IoT devices to study their internals, creating home-labs to play purple-team, and (attempting) to write assembly to exploit binaries. 

When I'm not infront of the screens, i'm out soaking up the sunshine on my motorbike, or getting chalky in the climbing gym.
